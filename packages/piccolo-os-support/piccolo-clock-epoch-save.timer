Description=Piccolo clock epoch periodic save timer

[Timer]
# Persistent=true intentionally NOT used — that's the anti-pattern
# that caused the original incident (large NTP step firing backlogged timers).
# Monotonic timers (OnBootSec/OnUnitActiveSec) don't support Persistent anyway.
OnBootSec=5min
OnUnitActiveSec=1h
