# Piccolo OS UEFI + TPM Implementation Plan

## üéØ Project Objectives

**What:** Transform Piccolo OS into a UEFI-only, TPM-enabled secure platform
**Why:** Modern security architecture requires UEFI Secure Boot and TPM measured boot for trustworthy systems

**Primary Goals:**
1. **UEFI-only bootable ISO** - Remove legacy BIOS support entirely
2. **TPM measured boot** - Enable hardware-based boot integrity verification  
3. **Predictable PCR values** - Allow remote attestation and sealed secrets
4. **Secure Boot chain** - Enforce signed bootloader ‚Üí kernel trust chain
5. **Clean architecture** - Remove Ignition complexity for API-driven management

**Success Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ ISO boots on any UEFI system (2012+)
- ‚úÖ TPM measurements are consistent per build version
- ‚úÖ `piccolod` provides attestation APIs
- ‚úÖ Maintains existing functionality and performance

## üìã Phase 1: UEFI-Only ISO Architecture

**What:** Convert current hybrid BIOS/UEFI ISO to pure UEFI boot
**Why:** Legacy BIOS compromises security and adds complexity without benefit for privacy-focused users

**Scope:**
- Remove `isolinux`, `syslinux`, MBR boot code
- Implement pure EFI system partition (ESP) structure
- Simplify GRUB configuration for single boot path
- Remove Ignition first-boot detection logic
- Update test infrastructure for UEFI QEMU testing

**Deliverables:**
- UEFI-only ISO generation
- Simplified GRUB configuration  
- Updated test scripts with OVMF firmware
- Documentation of system requirements

## üìã Phase 2: TPM Measured Boot Implementation

**What:** Enable TPM-based boot integrity measurements and verification
**Why:** Hardware-based attestation provides cryptographic proof of boot integrity for zero-trust environments

**Scope:**
- Leverage existing GRUB TPM module (PCR 8+9 measurements)
- Calculate expected PCR values at build time
- Implement build-time measurement prediction
- Enable runtime PCR verification
- Support both TPM 1.2 and 2.0 devices

**Deliverables:**
- Predictable PCR calculation methodology
- Build-time expected values generation
- TPM measurement verification tools
- Boot integrity status reporting

---

## üìã Phase 3: Build System Integration

**What:** Integrate UEFI and TPM features into existing build pipeline
**Why:** Seamless integration ensures consistent builds and maintains developer workflow

**Scope:**
- Modify `build_piccolo.sh` for UEFI-only artifact generation
- Update `test_piccolo_os_image.sh` for UEFI testing with OVMF
- Include TPM expected values in build artifacts
- Enhance build verification and validation
- Update CI/CD pipeline compatibility

**Deliverables:**
- Modified build scripts
- Enhanced testing framework
- Build artifact verification
- Continuous integration updates

---

## üìã Phase 4: API Integration & Attestation

**What:** Extend `piccolod` with TPM attestation and system capability APIs
**Why:** API-driven attestation enables remote verification and security monitoring

**Scope:**
- Add TPM PCR reading capabilities to `piccolod`
- Implement boot integrity verification endpoints
- Create system capability detection
- Enable remote attestation support
- Provide security status reporting

**Deliverables:**
- `/api/v1/attestation/pcr-values` endpoint
- `/api/v1/attestation/boot-integrity` endpoint  
- `/api/v1/system/capabilities` endpoint
- TPM interaction library (`internal/tpm/`)
- Security status dashboard integration

---

## üìã Phase 5: Testing & Validation

**What:** Comprehensive testing across hardware and virtual environments
**Why:** Ensure compatibility and reliability across diverse deployment scenarios

**Scope:**
- Hardware compatibility validation (Intel, AMD, ARM64)
- Virtual environment testing (QEMU, VMware, VirtualBox, Hyper-V)
- Security feature verification (Secure Boot, TPM, PCR consistency)
- Performance impact assessment
- Regression testing for existing functionality

**Deliverables:**
- Hardware compatibility matrix
- Virtual environment test suite
- Security feature validation reports
- Performance benchmarks
- Regression test results

---

## üìã Phase 6: Documentation & Release

**What:** Complete documentation and prepare for production release
**Why:** Clear documentation ensures successful adoption and reduces support burden

**Scope:**
- User migration guides (BIOS to UEFI transition)
- Developer documentation (PCR calculation, attestation protocols)
- System requirements specification
- Troubleshooting guides
- Security architecture documentation

**Deliverables:**
- User migration documentation
- Technical specification documents
- API documentation updates
- Security best practices guide
- Release notes and changelog

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Assessment

**Technical Risks:**
- **Legacy hardware exclusion** - Some users may have pre-2012 systems
- **TPM availability** - Not all systems have TPM enabled or available
- **PCR calculation complexity** - Measurement prediction may be challenging
- **Virtual environment compatibility** - Some VMs may not support TPM emulation

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Clear system requirements communication
- Graceful degradation when TPM unavailable
- Comprehensive testing across environments
- Fallback modes for limited hardware

**Business Risks:**
- **User migration friction** - Existing BIOS users need hardware upgrades
- **Increased complexity** - More sophisticated security may impact ease of use
- **Support burden** - New features may increase support requests

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Phased rollout with clear migration paths
- Comprehensive documentation and guides
- Community feedback integration
- Automated diagnostics and troubleshooting tools

## üîß Test Script UEFI Compatibility

**Current Status:** The existing `test_piccolo_os_image.sh` needs minimal modification for UEFI support.

**Required Change:**
```bash
# Add UEFI firmware to QEMU command:
qemu-system-x86_64 \
    -drive if=pflash,format=raw,readonly=on,file=/usr/share/ovmf/OVMF.fd \
    -drive file="$iso_path",media=cdrom,format=raw \
    -boot order=d \
    ...
```

**‚úÖ OVMF firmware available:** `/usr/share/ovmf/OVMF.fd`
